# Slay The Spire - The Remnant

## Introduction

A mod for Slay The Spire which adds a brand new character, The Remnant, to the game.

This mod features 75 new cards, 11 new character-specific Relics, 3 new character-specific Potions, and a new final boss that replaces the Corrupt Heart: The Void Warden.

## Gameplay / Mechanics
The Remnant has some unique tools at his disposal to eliminate enemies.
### Soul
At the end of your turn, deal damage to a random enemy. Lose 1 Soul when you play a card.
### Soulcast
Trigger the specified effect as long as you have at least 1 Soul.
### Shatter
If the enemy has 10 or more Shatter, remove it and Stun them. The amount of Shatter needed to Stun increases with every successful Stun. Enemies lose half of their Shatter at the start of their turn.
### Sacrifice
More powerful than other cards, but they consume Bones when played. Make sure not to end combat with negative Bones...
